> Is the story best told as a _chronological_ narrative? 

**Use Timeline.js to build a timeline of your story.**

1. Create a new [Timeline](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) project 
1. Make a copy of their Spreasheet template to your Google Drive
1. Drop the dates, titles and links to your photos in the spreadsheet
1. Change only data in rows. Don't change or delete columns
1. Don't leave any rows blank. Delete any rows you don't need
1. Publish the spreadsheet to the web to get a URL
1. Paste the URL into the Timeline.js project
1. Publish your Timeline and share the link in the chat
1. Copy the embed code and paste it into your GitHub docs

**Note:**
- You can update the spreadsheet any time and the timeline will update automatically.
- You can add any kind of link to the timeline including videos, audio, images, etc. 

**My Example**: 
- [StoryTL: My first year in Developer Advocacy](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1w6ID7OmlK7TRec6cuSzLlGcT7lqDGm5DNE-ASjjLncM&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)

**Let's Discuss**:
1. What worked with that approach?
1. What didn't work with that approach?
1. What would you change to make it better?
