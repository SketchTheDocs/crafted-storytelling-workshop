> Is the story best told as a _spatial_ narrative? 

**Use Timeline.js to build a timeline of your story:**
1. Create a new [StoryMap](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) project
2. Pre-work: Collect 10-15 photos that tell your story
3. Walk through the [StoryMap tutorial](https://storymap.knightlab.com/advanced/) 
4. Add your photos and text to the StoryMap, with location annotations
5. Publish your StoryMap and share the link in the chat
6. Download the StoryMap as a ZIP file, extract as static website

**Let's Discuss**:
1. What worked with that approach?
1. What didn't work with that approach?
1. What would you change to make it better?

**My Example**:
