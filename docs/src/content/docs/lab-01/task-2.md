## Emotional Connection

Stories are about sharing experiences and often that requires you to create an emotional connection to your audience. When you do the exercise above, think about how you felt at each of those moments.

- What was the date? Was that date important?
- What was the location? Was that location important?
- How did you feel? (then and now)
- What did you learn? (then and now)
- What did you do (to celebrate or to move forward)?
- **How does that contribute to your hero's journey?**
 
Think not just about what to include - but what to leave out. _Declutter timelines and story maps to keep the desired journey in focus._ We can then use the key dates, locations, insights and emotions - to build a narrative that resonates with our audience.
