## Starting Narrative

Telling your story can be difficult if you don't know where to start. Try to keep things simple by identifying a few highlights that lend themselves to storytelling. Think of:

1. 3 **moments in time** that were meaningful to this story. 
1. 3 **locations** that were meaningful to this story.
1. 3 **growth moments** that were meaningful to this story.
1. The **next destination** you are aiming for, with this journey.

## Emotional Connection

Stories are about sharing experiences and often that requires you to create an emotional connection to your audience. When you do the exercise above, think about how you felt at each of those moments.

- What was the date? Was that date important?
- What was the location? Was that location important?
- How did you feel? (then and now)
- What did you learn? (then and now)
- What did you do (to celebrate or to move forward)?
- **How does that contribute to your hero's journey?**
 
Think not just about what to include - but what to leave out. _Declutter timelines and story maps to keep the desired journey in focus._ We can then use the key dates, locations, insights and emotions - to build a narrative that resonates with our audience.

## Task 1: Define your story arc

1. What is the journey you want to share?
1. What are the key **locations** in your journey?
1. What are the key **timestamps** in your journey?
1. What are the key **growth moments** in your journey?
1. Why do you want to share your story?
1. What do you want your audience to take away from your story?

## Task 2: Collect support materials

1. Collect 10-15 photos that tell your story
1. Write down the key **locations** for each photo
1. Write down the key **timestamps** for each photo
1. Write down the key **growth moments** for each photo
1. Write down a "title" for that milestone. Make it memorable and share context.
1. Write down yoyr "story" for that milestone. Make it personal and share insights.
