## Starting Narrative

Telling your story can be difficult if you don't know where to start. Try to keep things simple by identifying a few highlights that lend themselves to storytelling. Think of:

1. 3 **moments in time** that were meaningful to this story. 
1. 3 **locations** that were meaningful to this story.
1. 3 **growth moments** that were meaningful to this story.
1. The **next destination** you are aiming for, with this journey.
