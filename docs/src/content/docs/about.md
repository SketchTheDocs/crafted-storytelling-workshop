description: Welcome to the CrafTED Storytelling Workshop
---

What if we could craft a TED talk that tells our professional story to prospective employers or audiences? What would we say? How would we say it? How can we take that story further and make it scale to online audiences everywhere? This 60-minute workshop breaks down the template, tools and text prompts that can help us reclaim our narrative.

## Pre-Requisites
- Have a Google account. We'll use Google Spreadsheets.
- Have a GitHub account. We'll use a GitHub repo so save our work.
- Have a Story to tell. We'll use Timeline.js and StoryMap.js to tell it.
- Have a Pen and Paper. We'll learn to sketch some elements.

## Learning Objectives

Everyone has a story to tell. In this workshop we want to explore this from multiple perspectives:
 - Why do we want to tell our story?
 - What is the story we want to tell?
 - How can we tell our story to different audiences?
 - How can we tell our story in different formats?
 - How can we use visual storytelling to draw audience attention?
 - How can we use generative AI to build our creative skills?
